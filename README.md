Python interface for Gmsh.

The goal of the module is to combine the power of Gmsh with the versatility of a proper scripting language.
The basic idea is to write a set of functions which automatically create a .geo-file, ready to be processed by Gmsh.

The folder examples/ contains scripts that showcase some of the methods.

This is very much work in progress; your mileage may vary.
