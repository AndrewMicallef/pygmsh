class SurfaceLoop:
    """
    Creates a surface loop (a shell).
    Increments the Line ID every time a new object is created that inherits
    from LineBase.

    Parameters
    ----------
    id0 : str
        The surface loopâ€™s identification number.
        If `None` then the object's global ID is incremented.
    surfaces : list
        Contain the identification numbers of all the elementary
        surfaces that constitute the surface loop.

    Notes
    -----
    A surface loop must always represent a closed shell, and the
    elementary surfaces should be oriented consistently (using
    negative identification numbers to specify reverse orientation).
